# SPE 2023 Community Latex Template Done Right

For some reason SPE hates latex users. And their [new template](https://www.spe.org/media/filer_public/50/43/504391f9-d62b-4ca1-a953-e6a582c54016/spe-manuscript-template_2023.tex) neither uses standard `\seciton` and `figure`, but also has 38 compilation errors.

This repository is my attempt to fix it (armed with ChatGPT). If you use this template, acknowledging this would be appreciated as described in Acknowledgement.

## Status
Implemented and tested enviornments:
 - Seciton / Subsection / Subsubsection
 - Figure
 - Table

## Futher work
Implement styles for the header of the document.

Please contribute to the repository if you improve the template, and add your name to acknowledgemnts.
