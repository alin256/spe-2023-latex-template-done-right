# SPE 2023 Latex Template Done Right

For some reason SPE hates latex users. And their [new template](https://www.spe.org/media/filer_public/50/43/504391f9-d62b-4ca1-a953-e6a582c54016/spe-manuscript-template_2023.tex) neither uses standard `\seciton` and `figure`, but also has 38 compilation errors (as of Feb. 20, 2026).
 
This template and its author(s) are neither affiliated nor want to be affiliated with SPE. By using it, you agree to all the consequences of being awesome and not leaning-in to unneccessary market domination of an inferior MSWord products.

This repository is my attempt to fix it (armed with ChatGPT). If you use this template, acknowledging this would be appreciated as described in Acknowledgement.

## Status
Implemented and tested enviornments:
 - Seciton / Subsection / Subsubsection
 - Figure
 - Table
 - Decent reference style

## Futher work
Implement styles for the header of the document.

Currently the original examples are kept still giving compilation issues - they would be removed in later versions. 

Please contribute to the repository if you improve the template, and add your name to acknowledgemnts.
